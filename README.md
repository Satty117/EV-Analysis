This project explores electric vehicle data to understand trends in EV adoption across the United States. It uses data on vehicle locations, model years, electric ranges, and prices to analyze how electric vehicles have grown in different states over time.

We use Python, along with libraries like Pandas and Plotly, to process the data and create visualizations. The project includes an animated map showing the number of EVs in each state, and a bar chart animation that highlights the top EV manufacturers over the years.

To run the project, clone the repository, install the required libraries, and open the Jupyter notebook to explore the analysis. In the future, we aim to expand the project to include more data, such as charging stations, and explore global EV trends.
